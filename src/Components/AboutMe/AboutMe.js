      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I love to create. Whether that is a woodworking project, a floral arrangement or a web app, I enjoy solving the problems that come up as you move from raw materials to a finished product. In the real world, I have a great sense of form, color, and 3 dimensional space and a lavish sense of creativity. In the digital world I can move from a general brief, through the planning stage, into designing my individual functions while working on my own or in groups. I'm looking to put my creative skills to use in the tech industry and would love to join any company who makes great high quality products! Need a junior front end software engineer? Need a florist for your wedding or event? You can contact me at dylan.hofmann@gmail.com</p>
